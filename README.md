# DX Lab: Meridian

## Introduction

The State Library of NSW owns a stunning collection of maps from the 17th and 18th centuries. Normally under lock and key in our underground stacks, Meridian brings these artefacts to life as interactive 3D globes.

This repository contains all code and project files.

### Maps

- [Miranda's World Map](https://collection.sl.nsw.gov.au/record/74VvkA2dEL83)
- [Coronelli Terrestrial Globe](https://collection.sl.nsw.gov.au/record/74VvAy5EdPgg)
- [Coronelli Celestial Globe](https://collection.sl.nsw.gov.au/record/74VvABRw02K3)

With more to come...

### Technology

Meridian can be served as a static HTML application. The following Javascript libraries are used:

- [three.js](https://threejs.org)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [TweenLite](https://greensock.com/tweenlite)

For local development, Node.js is used in conjunction with the following libraries:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
- [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/)

## Getting Started

Make sure Node.js is installed, then clone and run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Then go to `http://localhost:3001` to see the app in action! `Browsersync` will detect changes in the code and update on the fly.

## Deployment

Just copy the `/build` folder to any server.

Internally, we use `vercel` for deployments. Environments variables are on Vercel's dashboard.

```
$ npm run deploy
```
